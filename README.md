First Install the required packages (if not already installed):
pip install azure-identity azure-keyvault-secrets

If the pip command is not found, it typically means that Python or pip is not installed or not added to your system's PATH. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

python --version
OR
python3 --version

pip --version

Download get-pip.py:
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

Run the script:
python get-pip.py
OR
python3 get-pip.py
